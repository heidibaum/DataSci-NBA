# DataSci-NBA

Fun little data science project to visualize player data* using PCA, identify anomalous NBA players, and predict all-star status using logistic regression.  (*based on 2017-2018 stats).

Main project script NBA.m imports data and calls additional functions. Glossary of variables is NBA_vars.txt.

Note: some machine learning functions/tools adapted from samples/exercises from Coursera Machine Learning course (instructor: Andrew Ng).
